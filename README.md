# Hangman Game

This is a simple console-based Hangman game implemented in Java. The player needs to guess a word randomly chosen by the computer within a limited number of attempts.

## Getting Started

1. Run the program.
2. You will be prompted to start a new game or exit.
3. Choose "N" for a new game or "E" to exit.

## Game Rules

1. You have a limited number of attempts (default is 5).
2. Enter a letter to check if it is in the chosen word.
3. If the letter is in the word, it will be revealed; otherwise, you lose an attempt.
4. Keep entering letters until you guess the word or run out of attempts.

## Additional Settings

- Words for guessing are loaded from the `russian_nouns4.txt` file. You can add your own words to this file.

## Notes

- The game uses a console interface.
- Try to guess the word and avoid the "gallows"!

**Good luck and have fun!**
